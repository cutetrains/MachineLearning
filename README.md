## OilPrice
OilPrice collects daily oil price numbers from a dataset in Quandl. Using that data, it calculates some correlations, generates a training set and trains some machine learninga algorithms to predict the future oil price, given current oil price. 

So far, I haven't seen any successful predictions over time.
